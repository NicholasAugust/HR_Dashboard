# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard (Power BI + SQL)
This project is a fully interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI, supported by SQL queries for backend data processing. It’s designed to monitor key workforce metrics like headcount trends, attrition rate, departmental breakdowns, and more — with insights driven by real-world data.
